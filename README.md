### Description
This is the public repository for JIRA Control, a pressure sensitive JIRA client for iOS.
Using the app requires an iPhone 6s as _3DTouch_ is needed. The development of JIRA Control was part of my bachelors thesis and was supported by [Scandio GmbH](https://www.scandio.de "Scandio GmbH").
The project is described in further detail [here](https://www.scandio.de/blog/en/2016/05/jira-control-a-pressure-sensitive-jira-client).
Please note: This App was never build for production use but for the conducted experiments only.

If you have any questions regarding this project feel free to drop me an e-mail.
